# Ballerina Google Calendar Connector 
Connects to Google Calendar using Ballerina.

# Introduction
## Google Calendar
[Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar) is a time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google. It lets users to organize their schedule and share events with others. The Google Calendar endpoint allows you to access the Google Calendar API Version v3 through Ballerina.

## Key Features of Google Calendar
* Manage Events
* Manage Calendar
* Listen event changes - [Push Notification](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/push)

## Connector Overview

The Google Calendar Ballerina Connector allows you to access the Google Calendar API Version V3 through Ballerina. The connector can be used to implement some of the most common use cases of Google Calendar. The connector provides the capability to programmatically manage events and calendar, CRUD operations on event and calendar operations through the connector endpoints and listener for the events created in the calendar.

# Prerequisites

* Java 11 Installed
  Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 11 is required.

* Download the required Ballerina [distribution](https://ballerinalang.org/downloads/) version

## Compatibility

### Obtaining Tokens

1. Visit [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com), click **Create Project**, and follow the wizard to create a new project.
2. Go to **Credentials -> OAuth consent screen**, enter a product name to be shown to users, and click **Save**.
3. On the **Credentials** tab, click **Create credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**. 
4. Select an application type, enter a name for the application, and specify a redirect URI (enter https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground if you want to use 
[OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) to receive the authorization code and obtain the 
access token and refresh token). 
5. Click **Create**. Your client ID and client secret appear. 
6. [Enable Calendar API in your app's Cloud Platform project.](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project#enable-api)
7. In a separate browser window or tab, visit [OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground).
8. Click the gear icon in the upper right corner and check the box labeled **Use your own OAuth credentials** (if it isn't already checked) and enter the OAuth2 client ID and OAuth2 client secret you obtained above.
9. Select required Google Calendar scopes, and then click **Authorize APIs**.
10. When you receive your authorization code, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens** to obtain the refresh token and access token. 

### Add configurations file

* Instantiate the connector by giving authentication details in the HTTP client config. The HTTP client config has built-in support for Bearer Token Authentication and OAuth 2.0. Google Calendar uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate and authorize requests. It uses the Direct Token Grant Type. The Google Calendar connector can be minimally instantiated in the HTTP client config using the OAuth 2.0 access token.
    * Access Token 
    ``` 
    calendar:CalendarConfiguration config = {
        oauth2Config: {
            token: <access token>
        }
    }
    ```

    The Google Calendar connector can also be instantiated in the HTTP client config without the access token using the client ID, client secret, and refresh token.
    * Client ID
    * Client Secret
    * Refresh Token
    * Refresh URL
    ```
    calendar:CalendarConfiguration config = {
        oauth2Config: {
            clientId: <clientId>,
            clientSecret: <clientSecret>,
            refreshToken: <refreshToken>,
            refreshUrl: <refreshUrl>
        }
    }
    ```
* Callback address is additionally required in order to use Google Calendar listener. It is the path of the listener resource function. The time-to-live in seconds for the notification channel is provided in optional parameter expiration time. By default it is 604800 seconds.
  * Callback address
  * Expiration time

* Add the project configuration file by creating a `Config.toml` file under the root path of the project structure.
This file should have following configurations. Add the tokens obtained in the previous step to the `Config.toml` file.

  ```
  clientId = "<client_id">
  clientSecret = "<client_secret>"
  refreshToken = "<refresh_token>"
  refreshUrl = "<refresh_URL>"
  address = "<address>"
  ```


# Quickstart(s)

## Create an quick add event
### Step 1: Import the Calendar module
First, import the `ballerinax/googleapis.calendar` module into the Ballerina project.
```ballerina
import ballerinax/googleapis.calendar;
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Calendar Client giving necessary credentials
You can now enter the credentials in the Calendar client config.
```ballerina
calendar:CalendarConfiguration config = {
    oauth2Config: {
        clientId: <CLIENT_ID>,
        clientSecret: <CLIENT_SECRET>
        refreshToken: <REFRESH_TOKEN>,
        refreshUrl: <REFRESH_URL>,
    }
};

calendar:Client calendarClient = check new (config);
```
Note: Must specify the **Refresh token**, obtained with exchanging the authorization code, the **Client ID** and the 
**Client Secret** obtained in the App creation, when configuring the Calendar connector client.


### Step 3: Set up all the data required to create the quick event
The `quickAddEvent` remote function creates an event. The `calendarId` represents the calendar where the event has to be created and `title` refers the name of the event.

```ballerina
string calendarId = "primary";
string title = "Sample Event";
```

### Step 4: Create the quick add event
The response from `quickAddEvent` is either an Event record or an `error` (if creating the event was unsuccessful).

```ballerina
//Create new quick add event.
calendar:Event|error response = calendarClient->quickAddEvent(calendarId, title);

if (response is calendar:Event) {
    // If successful, log event id
    log:printInfo(response.id);
} else {
    // If unsuccessful
    log:printError("Error: " + response.toString());
}
```

## Create an listener for new event creation
### Step 1: Import the Calendar module
First, import the `ballerinax/googleapis.calendar`, `import ballerinax/googleapis.calendar.'listener as listen` and `import ballerina/http` modules into the Ballerina project.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/googleapis.calendar;
import ballerinax/googleapis.calendar.'listener as listen;
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Calendar Client giving necessary credentials
You can now enter the credentials in the Calendar client config.
```ballerina
calendar:CalendarConfiguration config = {
    oauth2Config: {
        clientId: <CLIENT_ID>,
        clientSecret: <CLIENT_SECRET>
        refreshToken: <REFRESH_TOKEN>,
        refreshUrl: <REFRESH_URL>,   
    }
};

calendar:Client calendarClient = check new (config);
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Calendar Listener
Define all the data required to create

```ballerina
int port = 4567;
string calendarId = "primary";
string address = "callback_url;

listener listen:Listener googleListener = new (port, calendarClient, calendarId, address);
```

### Step 4: Create the listener service
If there is an event created in calendar, log will print the event title

```ballerina
service /calendar on googleListener {
    remote function onNewEvent(calendar:Event event) returns error? {
        log:printInfo("Created new event : ", event);
    }
}
```

Samples are available at : https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-googleapis.calendar/tree/main/samples
To run a sample, create a new TOML file with name `Config.toml` in the same directory as the `.bal` file with above-mentioned configurable values. Configurable value port is additionally required in order to use listener.

```
port = "<port>"
```
Run this command inside sample directory:
    ```shell
    $ bal run "<ballerina_file>"
    ```
